The files in this directory constitute the style and template files for Pangolin Notebook.  They are used during the processing and output steps driven by the [Makefile-main.mk](../Makefile-main.mk) file in the parent directory.  Some of the contents came from other sources; please see the different subdirectories for more information about that.
