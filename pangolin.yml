# The following variable lists the pages that are included in the notebook.
# The order is significant: the order in which files are listed here is the
# order in which they will be inserted by the string "$contents" on the front
# page (see below).  Precede each file name in the following list with a
# space-dash-space character sequence, as shown in the examples below.
# Remember to update this every time you add another content file!

content-pages:
 - page1.md
 - page2.md
 - page3.md

# The following indicates the directory containing the pages listed above.
# Formatted output will be produced in the same directory.

content-dir: contents

# The next variable determines which input file is used to produce the front
# page of the formatted notebook (i.e., index.html).  The text inside this
# file should contain one instance of the literal string "$contents" (without
# the quotes) to indicate where the table of contents should be placed on the
# page.  The rest of the page content is up to you.  Make sure to put this
# file inside the contents-dir location indicated above.

front-page: front.md

# The next variable determines which of the input files is used as the basis
# of the "About" page for the notebook.  Make sure to put this file inside
# the contents-dir location indicated above.

# will be something like "https://yourlogin.github.io/yournotebook".

# (Optional) The URL to the source repo for your notebook, if you want to show
# this in the navigation bar.  This can be, for example, the GitHub repo URL.
# Leave empty if the resource repo is not public.

source-url:   CHANGE-THIS-TO-YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL

# (Optional) Select a different bibliography format style.  The value of
