Pangolin Notebook is a system for easily creating an online notebook written using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)-flavored [Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html), with support for citations, mathematics, auto-generation of previews while you write, and hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

‚ú∫ Introduction
-------------

Pangolin Notebook grew out of a desire for a simple way to write documents, with the following criteria:

* write in plain text using a simple notation such as Markdown
* include citations, with references stored in BibTeX format
* include mathematics written in TeX notation
* auto-generate previews while editing on a local computer
* use GitHub Pages to host the formatted results
* use GitHub to store the source files and allow collaboration with other people

There exist are other, similar systems, but in every case that I tried, I encountered a limitation or source of frustration.  Ultimately, I was led to create Pangolin Notebook.  I do realize Pangolin Notebook is yet another variation on a common theme.  Nevertheless, if you are looking for the same feature set, please feel free to use it as a starting point for your own work&mdash;perhaps this particular formulation will be useful to you too.

The "Pangolin" in the name is a loose acronym for _**PAN**doc-based **G**ithub d**O**cuments in htm**L** us**I**ng markdow**N**_.  (By the way, [pangolins are the most trafficked mammals](https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21736108-help-though-may-be-coming-some-natures-weirdest-mammals-are-some-most) in the world because stupid humans mistakenly think that eating them provides health benefits.  Please [learn more about them](http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/short-film-showcase/the-tragic-tale-of-a-pangolin-the-worlds-most-trafficked-animal) and the [cruel way people treat them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin_trade#Black_market), and [help stop their hunting](http://savepangolins.org/help/) before they are driven to extinction.)

‚ú∫ Installing Pangolin Notebook
------------------------------

### ‚ìµ&nbsp;&nbsp; _Install software that Pangolin Notebook depends upon_

Before you can use Pangolin Notebook, you will need the following software installed on your computer (using whatever method you prefer on your computer):

* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) version 2.1 or later, with LaTeX and BibTeX support
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
* [fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) (if you want to use Pangolin Notebooks' auto-rebuild approach)
* Common Unix/Linux utility programs such as `bash`, `ls`, `cp`, etc. 

### ‚ì∂&nbsp;&nbsp; _Install Pangolin Notebook_

The basic approach to setting up Pangolin Notebook is to create a fresh directory for your new notebook, add the Pangolin Notebook source files into a subdirectory of that directory, and do a couple of configuration steps to set up the notebook.  In more detail, the following steps should get you started:

1. Create a directory for your notebook and `cd` into it
2. Run the command `git init`
3. Run the command `git submodule add https://github.com/mhucka/pangolin-notebook.git`
4. Run the command `./pangolin-notebook/setup`

### ‚ì∑&nbsp;&nbsp; _Configure Pangolin Notebook_

The last step in the installation above (running `setup`) copies a file named `pangolin.yml` into your notebook directory.  This file needs to be edited to set certain variables, which you can do using any text editor.  The file contains comments that explain the variables; only two variables _must_ be set because Pangolin Notebook cannot figure them out itself:

* `content-pages` &ndash; this contains a list of the files that constitute the top-level pages of your notebook.  **You need to update this variable every time you add a new notebook page**.
* `notebook-url` &ndash; the online URL (e.g., `https://yourlogin.github.io/yournotebook` if you're using GitHub Pages)

There are some additional variables in `pangolin.yml` that you can set, such as `source-url` if your notebook source files are public (e.g., if you store them in GitHub) and `bib-style` if you want to use a different reference style file.


‚ñ∫ Using Pangolin Notebook
------------------------

Writing documents is a matter of editing files in [Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) format (optionally writing references in [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Format) format and creating figures in any web-viewable format you choose), then running `make` in your notebook directory to (re)generate the HTML files for your notebook contents.  The latter process can be automated using the `make autorefresh` command, which uses a combination of JavaScript inserted into every HTML page and `fswatch` to let you keep a web browser open on your notebook and have it be refreshed automatically each time you save changes to your files.

### Writing documents and previewing the results

When you create new files in your `contents` directory, you need to update the list of pages in `pangolin.yml`.  The order in which the files are listed in the table of contents is the order in which they will appear on the front page of your notebook.

To generated formatted output, you can manually run the following command in your notebook directory:

```
make
```

The `index.html` file will be placed at the top level of your notebook directory, and the formatted output for all other pages will be placed in the `contents` directory.

Pangolin Notebook includes an auto-refresh facility that puts JavaScript code into every HTML page to detect that the underlying file has been changed. (It _only_ does this for files on your local computer, not for files located anywhere else&mdash;it will not do this on GitHub Pages, for example.)  This is meant to work in conjunction with a simple auto-re-`make` scheme to let you view the formatted HTML in a browser as you edit.  To take advantage of this, run the following command in your notebook directory:

```
make autorefresh
```

Then open a notebook page in your browser, and try editing the corresponding Markdown file.  After a second or two, the page in your web browser should refresh to show the changed version.
