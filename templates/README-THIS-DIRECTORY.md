# README-THIS-DIRECTORY

This is used in the Pandoc-based documentation pipeline.  The contents of this directory were largely taken from other sources.

The file [GitHub.html5](GitHub.html5) started out as the [GitHub Pandoc HTML5 Template](https://github.com/tajmone/pandoc-goodies/blob/master/templates/html5/github/GitHub.html5) from the [Pandoc-Goodies repository](https://github.com/tajmone/pandoc-goodies), as it existed on 2017-08-04.  There is [documentation about the features](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tajmone/pandoc-goodies/blob/master/templates/html5/github/GitHub-Template-Preview.html) in the repository on GitHub.  Note: the copy in this directory has been modified.
